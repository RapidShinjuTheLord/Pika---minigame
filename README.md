# Pika2---minigame
Short mini-game where you fight and evade enemies as pikachu on two parallel platforms. Apologies for the messy directory, but it should work as long as you run main.py.

Controls:
- Up key: jump
- Down key: shoot
- Left/Right key: movement
- Space key: crouch

1 point per enemy you defeat. Every 20 points, the difficulty increases and the backdrop changes. It's a simple game, but I hope you enjoy! Run main.py to play, and install pygame if you haven't.

Music composed by me, art by me, made in pixilart.
